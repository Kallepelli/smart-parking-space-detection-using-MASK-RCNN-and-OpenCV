            <h2>About the Project</h2>
            <p>
                The <strong>Smart Parking Space Detection</strong> system is an innovative solution aimed at modernizing urban parking management. With the increasing number of vehicles in urban areas, finding available parking spaces has become a significant challenge. This project leverages advanced technologies such as <strong>MASK-RCNN</strong> and <strong>OpenCV</strong> to automate the detection of vacant parking spaces in real-time.
            </p>
            <h3>Key Features:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Real-Time Detection:</strong> The system uses live camera feeds to monitor parking lots and detect available spaces instantly.</li>
                <li><strong>Advanced AI Integration:</strong> By employing <strong>MASK-RCNN</strong>, a state-of-the-art deep learning model, the system can accurately identify and segment individual parking spaces within a camera's field of view.</li>
                <li><strong>Scalability:</strong> The system can be scaled to cover large parking areas, making it suitable for use in shopping malls, stadiums, airports, and other large venues.</li>
                <li><strong>User-Friendly Interface:</strong> The system provides a simple and intuitive interface for users to interact with, including easy camera configuration and detection monitoring.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Technologies Used:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>MASK-RCNN:</strong> A deep learning model designed for instance segmentation tasks, allowing the system to accurately differentiate between occupied and vacant parking spaces.</li>
                <li><strong>OpenCV:</strong> An open-source computer vision library that facilitates the processing and analysis of the video feed from the camera, enabling the real-time application of the detection algorithms.</li>
                <li><strong>Python:</strong> The primary programming language used to integrate the various components of the system, including machine learning models and video processing.</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Project Goals:</h3>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Enhance Urban Mobility:</strong> By reducing the time drivers spend searching for parking, this project aims to alleviate traffic congestion in busy urban areas.</li>
                <li><strong>Improve Efficiency:</strong> Automating the detection process eliminates the need for manual checks, leading to more efficient management of parking resources.</li>
                <li><strong>Environmentally Friendly:</strong> By helping drivers find parking faster, the system reduces unnecessary driving, thereby lowering emissions and contributing to a cleaner environment.</li>
            </ul>
